The stock markets, which reached all-time highs in Feb 2020, fell by ~ 35% within 5 weeks, came back up and are now down only ~ 20%. However, there is a wide range of performance between sectors. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks like Amazon, Microsoft & Netflix are actually up on YTD basis, while Financials and Energy stocks are in the dumps.

However, once we get over the hangover of Coronavirus, these are the sectors that could stage the biggest recovery, but only if they are able to survive the current onslaught.

PS: I used quantmod & ggplot packages to create these graphs in R.

Update: (Jun 2020)

Last week, S&P500 retook the year-end level (3,230.78) on 8th June. However, not all stocks/sectors performed the same. While Tech and Health care stocks were expected to outperform, Energy and Consumer stocks were supposed to be laggards (at least until we have a cure).

However, from the date market made the bottom (23rd March), the stocks that gave the best performance were mostly Energy and Consumer. I was surprised to see the names of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Norwegian Cruise & MGM among the top 10 best performers from 23-Mar-20 to 8-Jun-20.

Needless to say, investors are desperately waiting for a vaccine.

Update: (Dec 2020)

2020: The year of TESLA and ZOOM 

What a year 2020 was, not just for us personally but for the governments, global economy, and financial markets. In a year that started with COVID19 and ended with one of the most important US Presidential elections, the performance of S&P500 could not have been predicted.
 

S&P500 started by falling more than 30% in Feb-March, but then rallied from there to continue scaling new highs in a year no one thought was possible as volatility receded. 
GROWTH continued to outperform VALUE in a year buoyed by low-interest rates and a stay-at-home economy. 
FAANG stocks continued to outperform, while BITCOIN again came back into folklore as Fed was busy printing money.

However, the year truly belonged to these two companies:
- ZOOM became a verb this year, emerging as a leader for video conferencing and a solution for the stuck-at-home workers.
- TESLA, finally included in the S&P500 at the fag end, continued its wild rise to emerge as the best performing stock (among S&P500 constituents) of 2020.

Given the uncertainty around the new virus strain and vaccination process, it'll be hard to predict how the markets will behave in the new year. All we can hope, is to not have such a topsy-turvy ride again.
