The stock markets, which reached all-time highs in Feb 2020, fell by ~ 35% within 5 weeks, came back up and are now down only ~ 20%. However, there is a wide range of performance between sectors. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks like Amazon, Microsoft & Netflix are actually up on YTD basis, while Financials and Energy stocks are in the dumps.

However, once we get over the hangover of Coronavirus, these are the sectors that could stage the biggest recovery, but only if they are able to survive the current onslaught.

PS: I used quantmod & ggplot packages to create these graphs in R.

Update on the above:

Last week, S&P500 retook the year-end level (3,230.78) on 8th June. However, not all stocks/sectors performed the same. While Tech and Health care stocks were expected to outperform, Energy and Consumer stocks were supposed to be laggards (at least until we have a cure).

However, from the date market made the bottom (23rd March), the stocks that gave the best performance were mostly Energy and Consumer. I was surprised to see the names of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Norwegian Cruise & MGM among the top 10 best performers from 23-Mar-20 to 8-Jun-20.

Needless to say, investors are desperately waiting for a vaccine.
