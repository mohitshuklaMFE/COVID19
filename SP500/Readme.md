The stock markets, which reached all-time highs in Feb 2020, fell by ~ 35% within 5 weeks, came back up and are now down only ~ 20%. However, there is a wide range of performance between sectors. Unsurprisingly, tech stocks like Amazon, Microsoft & Netflix are actually up on YTD basis, while Financials and Energy stocks are in the dumps.

However, once we get over the hangover of Coronavirus, these are the sectors that could stage the biggest recovery, but only if they are able to survive the current onslaught.

PS: I used quantmod & ggplot packages to create these graphs in R.
